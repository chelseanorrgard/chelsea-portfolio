## 🐶 Project Manager: Lucy

Yes, my 14-year-old chihuahua Lucy was the **official project manager** on this project. Responsibilities included:  
- Supervising from the couch 🛋️  
- Napping strategically to inspire productivity 😴  
- Randomly barking at bugs 🐾  
- Ensuring all code gets extra treats 🍪  

Lucy takes deadlines very seriously… as long as they don’t interfere with snack time.
